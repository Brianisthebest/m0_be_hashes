# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Remembering to name the variable in the pipes when runing the each method at first. I was trying to do it within the code block instead.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I'm taking notes during the lectures and when going through the assignments. It's been helpful to be able to look down and answer a question on something I'm learning and by the end of the assignment I'm usually feeling much more confident in myself.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I'll give it a good try at first to problem solve and learn on my own, but if it takes more time than I'd like I'll give it a google and then work backwards and figure out why it worked and what I was doing wasn't working.
